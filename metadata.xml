	<description>  [h1]Coop HUD[/h1]

		I've been tired of playing Isaac in coop with vanilla broken hud so I've created a new one.
		This mod is my try to render proper HUD for game like it should be from begging.

		[h3] [b] MOD IS STILL DEVELOPED PLEASE SUBMIT ANY WEIR BEHAVIOUR ( weird positions/ console errors/ log files)
		in Bugs topic[/b] [/h3]
		[h3] [b] MOD might get laggy when too much on screen. 4 normal players (exl. Jacob / Essau) works fine on my old
		laptop. Still working on optimalization [/b] [/h3]
		[h2] *NEW* [/h2]
		[list]
			[*] Stats - just like vanilla FoundHUD stat display:
				[list]
					[*] Highlight on map button
					[*] Stats colors - can turn on/off
					[*] Hide stats on battle - can turn on/off
					[*] Integration with Jacob / Essau - to show Essau stats while more than 2 player press map button *
				[/list]
					[*] MiniMAPI -  options override logic
					[*] 2 player HUD (big) position customizable
					[*] Player colors - fully customizable
		** While too much stuff on hud - all trinkets/pockets activeitems while playing J
		[/list]

		[h2] What this mod lack of[/h2]
			[list]
				[*] Boss bars – I won’t be messing with. I suggest using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2635267643] [Rep] Enhanced Boss Bars [/url] from  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wofsauge/myworkshopfiles/?appid=250900] Wofsauge[/url]
				My mod should override Boss bars settings in case bar covers coopHUD check options. If boss bar covers items change it padding in settings.
				[*] Minimap – Same as boss bars – Use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1978904635] MiniMAPI[/url] from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wofsauge/myworkshopfiles/?appid=250900] Wofsauge[/url]
				My mod should override MiniMAPI settings.
				Options should be:
				General -> Display on No HUD seed - On
				Map (1) - > Show map effect icons - Off
			[/list]
		[h2]Issues/ not working/missing[/h2]
			[list]
				[*] Urn of soul - only show open/close sprite state - no modding API function
				[*] Jar of Wisp - manual charge detection/ resets on restart- no modding API function
			[/list]
