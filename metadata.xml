		[h2] What this mod lack of[/h2]
		[list]
		[*] For menu options use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2487535818]Mod Config Menu - Continued[/url]
		[*] Boss bars – I won’t be messing with. I suggest using[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2635267643] [Rep] Enhanced Boss Bars [/url] from[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wofsauge/myworkshopfiles/?appid=250900] Wofsauge[/url]
		My mod should override Boss bars settings in case bar covers coopHUD check options. If boss bar covers items
		change it padding in settings.
		[*] Minimap – Same as boss bars – Use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1978904635]MiniMAPI[/url] from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wofsauge/myworkshopfiles/?appid=250900] Wofsauge[/url]
		My mod should override MiniMAPI settings.
		Options should be:
		General -> Display on No HUD seed - On
		Map (1) - > Show map effect icons - Off
		[/list]
