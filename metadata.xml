	<description>  [h1]Coop HUD[/h1]

		[h2] What this mod lack of[/h2]
			[list]
				[*] Boss bars – I won’t be messing with. I suggest using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2635267643] [Rep] Enhanced Boss Bars [/url] from  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wofsauge/myworkshopfiles/?appid=250900] Wofsauge[/url]
				My mod should override Boss bars settings in case bar covers coopHUD check options. If boss bar covers items change it padding in settings.
				[*] Minimap – Same as boss bars – Use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1978904635] MiniMAPI[/url] from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wofsauge/myworkshopfiles/?appid=250900] Wofsauge[/url]
				My mod should override MiniMAPI settings.
				Options should be:
				General -> Display on No HUD seed - On
				Map (1) - > Show map effect icons - Off
