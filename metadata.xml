This mod is my try to render proper HUD for game like it should be from begging.

[h2] What this mod lack of[/h2]
[list]
    [*] Boss bars – I won’t be messing with. I suggest using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2635267643] [Rep] Enhanced Boss Bars [/url] from  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wofsauge/myworkshopfiles/?appid=250900] Wofsauge
        My mod should override Boss bars settings in case bar covers coopHUD check options. If boss bar covers items change it padding in settings.
    [*] Minimap – Same as boss bars – Use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1978904635] MiniMAPI[/url] from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wofsauge/myworkshopfiles/?appid=250900] Wofsauge
        My mod should override MiniMAPI settings.
        Options should be:
            General -> Display on No HUD seed - On
            Map (1) - > Show map effect icons - Off
 [h2]Issues/ not working/missing[/h2]
[list]
[*] Urn of soul - only show open/close sprite state - no modding API function
[*] Jar of Wisp - manual charge detection/ resets on restart- no modding API function
